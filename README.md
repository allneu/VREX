# Intuitive VR Control Interface of Heavy Machinery

Virtual reality enables the creation of User Interfaces that are difficult or impractical to implement in the real world. This thesis focuses on designing and implementing an intuitive Virtual Reality (VR) control system for operating heavy construction machinery, such as excavators and loaders. Traditional control systems rely on a complex combination of levers, switches, and buttons, which require extensive training and pose challenges for new users. The proposed VR Control Interface simplifies this process by providing an immersive and intuitive control system that allows users to interact with a virtual model of the construction machine in a realistic manner. The system visualizes the machine's inertia and the positional difference between the current and desired states, enabling users to better understand and predict the machine's movements. A User Study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the VR Control Interface in comparison to traditional controls. The study examines key metrics such as task completion time, accuracy, and error rates, highlighting the potential of VR Control Interfaces to reduce learning time, improve operational accuracy, and enhance User Experience in Heavy Machinery operation.
