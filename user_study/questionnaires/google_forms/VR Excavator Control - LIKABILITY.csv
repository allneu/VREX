2024/11/03 1:53:12 PM GMT+1,CE1J,5,3,5,5,4,"I could well imagine the movement of the machine arm in releation to my own hand which made the manouvering much quicker, even though not so precise",The movement coud be very precise,4,3,"The slow reaction of the controled machine , which caused sometimes unwanted movements, also the need to contain the same position of the hand to a miniature was a little difficult.","Without the physical response, it is sometimes difficult to realise a direction in which I pull the joystick",Maybe more possible control points on the miniature
2024/11/03 4:34:47 PM GMT+1,A9AB,5,3,5,5,3,When I figured out how it works and how to effectively use my arm to control the miniature. It was very quick and user friendly.,"Nothing. It was hard to navigate which direction and which joystick to use, also it required coordination of both hands in different directions at the same time which quite hard to learn.",5,5,the reaction time/delay,That it is very difficult to do it quickly ,I wouldnt change a thing 
2024/11/03 1:51:30 PM GMT+1,1IM9,4,4,4,3,4,"Ability to move the real system. Very like the idea, but need to be updated in my opinion. ","Generally known idea. And when one axe is done, I do not destroy uts setting, because I can focus on other axes. ",3,3,"Not sure, how does it works. The miniature should meant wanted position but wanted positiin was given by position of cursor. I tried move the miniature, update position of hand and grab miniature again, but it moves, because I moved hand in the meanwhile.I set 3 out of 4 positions but on second grab everything gone wrong. Sometimes the excavator denied to go wherr the miniature was.",Positions of yjoysticks and combinetion of axes. ,The grabbing system - grab the miniature and use only movement of hand when grabbed (use only changes of relative position from grab point). Do not use absolute positin of hand. 
2024/11/03 5:17:37 PM GMT+1,1I1I,5,3,5,5,4,"It felt like a nice toy, very easy to use, did not have to think too much about the directions and so on","a lot harder to learn and for concentration, had to think about the directions a lot",5,5,none,also not,none
2024/11/03 6:51:02 PM GMT+1,F5S2,5,3,5,5,2,I liked that I could use the movement of my body as a controller which felt intuitive and I did not ghave to think as much,I had to think about the directions too much,5,5,"It would be enough to have just the big excavator, I did not have time to look at the small white one ",I liked that I could try out the directions but I found it a bit frustrating to remember it all and having to learn everything,-
2024/11/19 4:20:29 PM GMT+1,2JW5,4,4,4,4,4,"It was very sensitive so if you got it, you could really control it ",It was just very simple to get and easy to use,4,4,It takes a little bit of learning curve,The overall control over it stays rudimentary,Make it slightly less sensitive
2024/11/26 4:53:10 PM GMT+1,WSSL,5,3,5,5,3,It was more natural,It was really precise,3,3,The delay between the control and the actual movement,That I had to learn the controls,No or less delay
2024/11/27 11:10:13 PM GMT+1,RMYD,5,4,5,4,3,You didn‘t have to pay attention to holding the joysticks. ,Operating the machine seemed realistic. ,4,3,"Sometimes the miniature controlling point, with which the movement was controlled, wasn’t in the field of vision. ",There were no frustrating aspects.,"That the miniature controlling point, with which the movement is controlled, is always in the focus. "
2024/12/04 4:54:45 PM GMT+1,50O9,4,4,4,5,5,it is faster in non precise moves ,it is precise and predictable ,3,4,open close bucket was sometimes painful for the hand ,it felt sometimes slow ,i would impement the open close on 2 new buttons
