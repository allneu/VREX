# 🚀 Transforming Heavy Machinery Control Interfaces with VR  

This project isn't just a research experiment—it’s a **glimpse into the future of industrial operations**. By replacing **complex levers and buttons** with an **intuitive VR interface**, we’re making heavy machinery **faster to learn, easier to control, and more precise than ever**. Imagine reducing training time, minimizing errors, and boosting efficiency—all through an **immersive, game-like experience**.  

From construction sites to remote-controlled operations, this technology has the **potential to revolutionize the industry**, making machine control **smarter, safer, and more accessible** for the next generation of operators. 🔥  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- **`VREX_UNITY/`** – Contains the **Unity project** with the full implementation of the VR Control Interface.  
- **`blender_files/`** – 3D models and assets used for the VR interface, created in **Blender**.  
- **`screenshots/`** – Visuals showcasing the VR system, user study setup, and comparison of control methods.  
- **`user_study/`** – Includes **graphs, screenshots, and data** from the **user study**, evaluating performance metrics between traditional and VR controls.  
- **`Intuitive_VR_Interface_for_the_Control_of_...`** – The **final thesis document**, detailing the research, methodology, and findings.  
- **`VREX_presentation.pdf`** – The **final presentation**, summarizing the project and results.  

## 🎮 Try It Yourself!  

A **demo application** is available, allowing users to test both the **traditional joystick control** and the **newly designed VR interface**. Two sets of tasks help users experience firsthand how VR can **enhance precision, reduce errors, and speed up learning** in heavy machinery operation. 🚀
